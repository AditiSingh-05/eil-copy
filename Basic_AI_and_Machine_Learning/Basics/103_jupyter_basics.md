# Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough  

In last section we learnt how to activate our environment and open jupyter notebook, let's do it here(only if closed it and deactivated it).

## Main Interface

In your notebook, you are basically going to see two tabs - Files and Running.  

As name suggests, Files shows your entire folder structure where you are working and Running shows all the kernels or notebook that are currently running. 

In Files, you will see two tabs on the left,  New which can be used to create a new notebook, terminal, folder etc. and Upload to upload any file or folder.

## Inside Notebook

Let's open our first notebook, the one we created in the last section, just select it and press open. 

Now, let's talk about this interface - 

On the top you will see main menu which contains multiple menu and submenu, after that you have options bar which contains options like save, add a new cell, cut, copy, paste, run etc. You also need to remember that these cells are not just for code, you can also store Markdown in it. 

## Basic Shortcuts

- To run a cell - Shift + Enter
- To save - Ctrl + S
- Editor Mode to Command Mode - Esc
- Command Mode to Editor Mode - Enter
- Code to MarkDown - When in Command Mode - m
- Markdown to COde - When in Command Mode - y
- New cell below - When in Command Mode - b
- New cell above - When in Command Mode - a
- Delete cell - When in Command Mode - dd

## Few Takeaways 

- You can run code, markdown in jupyter.
- Run run command line code, add ! before your code
- Number before cell shows the progress, every time you run something, you are going to mark that cell as one number more. 
- Sequence of execution matters in jupyter.
